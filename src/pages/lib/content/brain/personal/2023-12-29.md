<b><2023></b>

- Laid off in Jan
- Burn out till May
- Did more OSS work
- Started a Computer Science Degree
- Started interacting more on Twitter
- Started exploring more languages and having fun with programming
- Made some online friends, since real friends is a hard thing
- Started to create the habit of reading, and so far I've read:
    - Metamorphosis - Franz Kafka
    - Fahrenheit 451 - Ray Bradbury
    - The Crow and Other Tales - Edgar Allan Poe
    - Berserk - Kentaro Miura

<b></2023></b>

And that's it. Not the best of the years, I did not get a job after the laid off, but in study matters, it was better than the last year.

My old job wasn't healthy for me, and I was sent off without receiving my last payment, so I even lost a month of work. I leave it behind.

I still have hopes for 2024. I think I've overcome the battles of 2023. I'm a new person, more mature.

Let's see what 2024 have for me.
